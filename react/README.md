This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

To make this application work, you must follow these steps. 
1. Download Ganache, make a quickstart blockchain network, copy the MNEMONIC at the top of the page. You will use this to log into metamask. 
2. Open the metamask extension on your browser. Login using the MNEMONIC from ganache. 
3. In metamask, click the 'Network' button at the top of the page. Choose Custom RPC.
    - Network Name: Private Network. 
    - New RPC URL: HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545 
        This is found in Ganache at the top of the screen underneath 'RPC Server'. We use this to 1. Connect our ganache to metamask 2. Inject our metamask web3 into the browser 3. Allow our application to recognize the injection from this source 
    - Chain ID: 1337
    - No optional fields. 
Once logged in, my user and pass were both testtest but I dont think this matters bc its local. 
4. npm start the application. Refresh until you get a notification in the metamask checking if you want the browser to be used. Say yes. Refresh the web page until the account address is displaying, proving the app is connected to metamask.
